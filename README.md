## 🚀 How to Use

2. 👨‍💻 **Edit your C# model** in the Model tab — define any class with public members to bind into your HTML.  
3. ✍️ Use the template syntax in your HTML, e.g., `{{ model.Name }}`, to inject model properties dynamically.  
4. 💾 Save your work with **Ctrl+S** or the Save buttons — the PDF preview updates automatically.  
5. 👀 Preview your rendered PDF in the built-in viewer.
